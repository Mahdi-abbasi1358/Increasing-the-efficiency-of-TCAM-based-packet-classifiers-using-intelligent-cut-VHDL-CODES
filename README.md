# Increasing-the-efficiency-of-TCAM-based-packet-classifiers-using-intelligent-cut-VHDL-CODES



Using packet classifier algorithms in packet processing network systems is the key idea to process packets rapidly. These algorithms are so important, especially in processor equipments used in internet backbones. Ternary content addressable memories (TCAM) are used to do parallel search in hardware implementation of these algorithms. Despite the accessibility of high-speed search, one of main problems to use TCAM is its high consumption power supply. In this study, a new technique is provided to reduce memory consumption in TCAM blocks which are used in hardware classifier. In classifier architecture, first, decision tree is created and classifier rules are distributed among its leaf nodes. Since each leaf of the tree corresponds to one TCAM block, rules are included in different blocks of TCAM corresponding to tree structure, in the second stage. In this architecture, a supplementary TCAM block is used as â€¦
